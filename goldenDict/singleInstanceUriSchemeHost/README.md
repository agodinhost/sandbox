Single Instance Uri Scheme Host

WARNING:

The Client build will create one extra EXE, the Client.vshost.exe.
This exe is created when the project property "Enable the Visual Studio hosting process" into the Debug tab.

The Installer is not important, it only does the register calls to persist the Chrome required info into the registry.
We will use two bat/shell scripts to simplify.
